#How to contribute

You can contribute to this repo by performing any of the following actions: 

1. Adding a feature
2. Debugging existing features
3. Suggesting features 
4. Editing documentation


#2. Debugging existing features. 

To debug existing features, features need to exist, so wait patiently till people start writing code that is inline with the repo's vision and get merged. 

To debug existing features, you'd need to create a fork of the project and clone to your local computer. 
Then test and figure out the buggy modules. 

#3. Suggesting new features. 
To suggest a new feature, just create a pr and talk about what new feature you think would make sense to be worked on on the primitive data type processor.

#4 Editing documentation. 

To edit documentation, all you need to do is fork the project and clone it to your local computer. Then edit the README.md file to what you want and create a PR.
