#How to contribute

You can contribute to this repo by performing any of the following actions: 

1. Adding a feature
2. Debugging existing features
3. Suggesting features 
4. Editing documentation

#2. Debugging existing features. 

To debug existing features, features need to exist, so wait patiently till people start writing code that is inline with the repo's vision and get merged. 

To debug existing features, you'd need to create a fork of the project and clone to your local computer. 
Then test and figure out the buggy modules.
